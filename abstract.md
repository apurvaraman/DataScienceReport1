# How do Europeans feel about Jewish, Muslim, and Gypsy immigration?
Apurva Raman and Celina Bekins

As tensions over immigration increase with Europe dealing with a huge influx of refugees, some countries are more ready to accept immigrants while others close their borders to them. To understand the opinions of Europeans on immigration of particular groups, we investigated if respondents from different countries in Europe have consistent opinions toward Jews, Muslims, and Gypsies. We found that countries with a strong preference against Jews or Gypsies will also not prefer the other group. This does not hold true for Jews; countries that are willing to allow Jews are not necessarily willing to allow Muslims or Gypsies. Countries that are not accepting of Jews are not accepting of any of these three groups. However, they all preferred Jews to Muslims and Muslims to Gypsies.

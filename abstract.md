# Abstract

### Motivating Question
Do respondents from different countries in Europe have consistent opinions toward immigrant groups? What patterns emerge between countries?

### Primary Result
The countries with high mean values for one group tend to have high mean values for all groups. This indicates that countries with a strong preference against immigration from one group tend to have a strong preference against immigration over all three groups.
The countries with the low mean values for a particular group tend to have low mean values for the other groups with the exception of Israel, which has an expectedly strong preference for immigration of Jews.
